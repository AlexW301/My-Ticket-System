# My-Ticket-System

A custom help desk solution I built as a hobbie project and used as a simple way for users to submit IT tickets to me and keep track of tickets. Unfortunately there is no live demo currently, as the heroku hosted backend is currently down, as they got rid of their free tier and this is just a hobbie project.
